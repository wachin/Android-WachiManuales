You could try installing Ubuntu Make and then installing Android Studio (that's what I did on 16.04). There's an article on the Ubuntu Wiki that covers it, but the steps are:

install Ubuntu Make directly from the Universe archive:

 $ sudo apt install ubuntu-make
Then use Ubuntu Make to install Android Studio:

 $ umake android
And that worked for me.

umake android
There may be an error message related to license that may be corrected using an additional parameter:

umake android --accept-license
Uninstall Android Studio :

umake android --remove

After that just delete Android Studio's related folders in your /home folder :
