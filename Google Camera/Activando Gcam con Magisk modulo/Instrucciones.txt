[Module] Camera2API enabler
https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-camera2api-enabler-t3656651

Since Google Camera with HDR+ was ported already, it requires that camera2api to be enabled.
This is done by editing build.prop to add or enable "persist.camera.HAL3.enabled=1".
Note:
This mod only adds camera2api support in the build.prop systemlessly. This does not guarantee modded google camera hdr+ will work on your device.

Axon 7 Users:
Here's a working GCAM that works on my device. However, I don't see any difference with my stock cam hdr. I just use this for slowmo, panorama, photosphere and lens blur effects.
MGCB_7.0H_C2API_Mid_v.3.6_AllinOne_Full_Manual.apk


Requirements:
Android 5.0 & up
Magisk v15
~2014+ Snapdragon SoCs

Instruction:
Add the zip in Magisk Manager -> Modules and reboot.
Or you could also flash it in your custom recovery, TWRP etc.

How to check if it is running:
1. Open terminal and issue command "getprop | grep camera".
If it's running, you should be able to find a line "persist.camera.HAL3.enabled=1". Check attached screenshot for example.
Or
2. Install Camera2 Probe from playstore to check your device's camera capabilities.

UPDATES:
9-15-17:
-added v1400 template
-added camera2api with slowmo fix for Axon 7 users. (I can't guarantee slowmo on other models will work since I used my device's media_profiles.xml file.)

-updated to v1500 template for C2API - Download this file if you only want the HAL3 enabled.
